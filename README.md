# Image-Description-with-Transformers
Overview
A project that leverages advanced machine learning models to generate descriptions for images automatically. This project uses the Hugging Face transformers library and the bitsandbytes library to optimize model performance in 4-bit precision, making it both powerful and efficient.

Features
Image to Text Description: Converts images into descriptive text using state-of-the-art machine learning models.
Optimized Performance: Utilizes 4-bit quantization for faster inference with minimal loss in accuracy.
Easy Integration: Designed to be easily integrated into existing or new Python applications.
Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

transformers
bitsandbytes
accelerate
Pillow (as a modern replacement for PIL)
torch
requests
Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Image-Captioning.git
cd AI-Image-Captioning
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the image captioning, execute the following command:

python
Copy code
python caption_image.py --image_path "<path_to_image>"
Replace <path_to_image> with the actual path to the image you want to describe.
